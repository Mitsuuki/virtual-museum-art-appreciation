          <h3>Emotions on Canvas (Painting)</h3>
          <p class="caption">"This painting beautifully captures a sense of wonder, freedom, and adventure. The bright blue sky symbolizes endless possibilities, while the fluffy white clouds create a dreamy atmosphere. The house, lifted by a massive cluster of colorful balloons, evokes feelings of hope and excitement, as if it‚Äôs embarking on a magical journey. The use of vibrant colors in the balloons adds joy and playfulness, making the viewer feel lighthearted. At the same time, the small house represents comfort and home, suggesting that no matter how far we go, we carry a sense of belonging with us. This piece radiates positivity and a childlike sense of curiosity. This painting was inspired by the movie from disney ‚ÄúUP‚Äù." by J. Maristela</p>

          <h3>Logo</h3>
          <p class="caption">"The logo for "The Fix-It Shop" expertly employs the principles of composition in graphic design. Symmetry and balance are achieved through the overlapping of two tools, creating a sense of stability and order. The proximity of the tools emphasizes unity and cohesion.

            Contrasting colors, black and orange, create visual interest and draw attention. The emphasis on the tools, through size and color, establishes a clear visual hierarchy. Movement and energy are conveyed through the overlapping tools.
            
            The circular shape, formed by the tools, represents unity and wholeness. The logo's limited color palette and simple shapes create a sense of cohesion and visual flow, achieving unity. Effective use of negative space creates clarity and balance.
            
            Overall, the logo effectively utilizes the principles of composition to convey "The Fix-It Shop" mission and values, establishing a strong visual identity for the brand.
