          <h3>Sculpture</h3>
          <p class="caption">This clay sculpture of a hibiscus flower symbolizes beauty, resilience, and transformation. The hibiscus is often associated with delicate yet powerful energy, representing fleeting moments of life and the importance of embracing the present. Its organic form, shaped with gentle curves and textured details, evokes a sense of natural elegance and grace. The neutral clay color adds simplicity, emphasizing the raw and unrefined beauty of nature. This piece can also symbolize growth and personal strength, as flowers bloom despite challenges. Overall, it conveys a message of appreciation for nature‚Äôs delicate yet enduring essence.

          <h3>Emotion on Canvas</h3>  
          <p class="caption">"Angry

            is an intense emotional state that involves a strong uncomfortable and uncooperative response to a perceived provocation, pain, or threat. The anger can result from perceptibly inequitable, compromising, or frustrating situations characterized by feelings of irritation, resentment, or even hostility and also by their overt physical manifestations or verbal outlet. When angry, one may observe his or her heart beating fast, muscular tension, increased blood flow to the skin, or clenched fists as signs of the state of anger. Thoughts are focused on the cause of this anger and the mind expresses a desire to confront or right the situation." by A. Tapec</p>
